# Case 4b of the Schmeling benchmark
# ---------------------------------
# This case is identical to case 3, except that two-phase flow is assumed 
# by choosing Rt = 50. In case 4a the CBA is assumed, while in case 4b full 
# compaction (FC) is studied. Due to melt segregation depleted and enriched 
# regions develop and are swept around in the model.
# 
# The requested output parameters can be found in the statistics file
# and can be plotted with gnuplot:
# Column 15: RMS velocity ("RMS velocity (m/s)")
# Column 22: Maximum melt fraction ("Maximal value for composition porosity")
# Column 23: Total melt volume ("Global mass for composition porosity")
# Column 30: Surface Nusselt number ("Outward heat flux through boundary with indicator 3 ("top") (W)")
