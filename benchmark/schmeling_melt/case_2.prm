# Case 2 of the Schmeling benchmark
# ---------------------------------
# This case is identical to case 1 except that latent heat is switched on by using 
# a finite St (=3.906), done in the parameter file by setting 
# set Include latent heat = true 
# and setting the Latent heat of melting (= cp DeltaT/St) to 0.256016385. No melt or 
# depletion buoyancies are assumed and no melt percolation is assumed (batch melting).
# The aim is to see the effect of cooling of the melting zone due to consumption and 
# release of latent heat, and the associated reduction of the melt fraction. Still 
# steady state should be reached.
# 
# The requested output parameters can be found in the statistics file
# and can be plotted with gnuplot:
# Column 14: RMS velocity ("RMS velocity (m/s)")
# Column 21: Maximum melt fraction ("Maximal value for composition porosity")
# Column 22: Total melt volume ("Global mass for composition porosity")
# Column 26: Surface Nusselt number ("Outward heat flux through boundary with indicator 3 ("top") (W)")
