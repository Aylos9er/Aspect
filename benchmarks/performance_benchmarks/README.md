This folder contains several performance benchmarks that can be used to
compare performance and scaling across different cluster systems.

Each setup is put into a separate folder, which contains the parameter file
and any additional plugin that may be necessary to run the benchmark. The
results from different clusters and visualization instructions are collected
in a separate 
[github repository](https://github.com/gassmoeller/aspect-performance-statistics ).
