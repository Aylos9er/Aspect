This folder contains several performance benchmarks that can be used to
compare performance and scaling across different cluster systems. 
Each setup is put into a separate folder, which contains the parameter file
and any additional plugin that may be necessary to run the benchmark. The
results from different clusters are put into subdirectories of the individual
setups.
