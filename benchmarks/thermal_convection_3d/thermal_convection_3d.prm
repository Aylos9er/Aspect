# A simple setup for thermal convection in a hollow sphere. The setup
# is based from Arrial et al. (2014) benchmark of CitcomS and a RBF-PS 
# model.

############### Global parameters
# We use a 3d setup. Here the equations of contuinity, momentum and
# energy are nondimensionalized with the timescale chosen as the
# thermal diffusion time of mantle minerals so that time t=1 which
# corresponds to 265 billion years.
set Dimension                              = 3
set Start time                             = 0
set End time                               = 1
set CFL number                             = 1
set Use years in output instead of seconds = false

############### Parameters describing the model
# The setup is a 3d spherical shell with a nondimensional length
# scale chosen as the approximate thickness of the mantle (i.e.
# mantle thickness = 1).
subsection Geometry model
  set Model name = spherical shell
  subsection Spherical shell
    set Inner radius    = 1.2222222222

subsection Boundary velocity model
  set Tangential velocity boundary indicators = bottom, top
end

# For some geometries and certain boundary conditions the velocity
# field is not uniquely determined but contains free translations
# and/or rotations. Angular momentum is here removed from the
# velocity field at the end of the Stokes solver step so that the
# net angular momentum is zero. See section 2.14 in the manual for
# more information.
subsection Nullspace removal
  set Remove nullspace = angular momentum 
end

# The dynamics of the fluid are entirely governed by the Rayleigh
# number Ra, which can be interpreted as a ratio of the destabilizing
# force due to the buoyancy of the heated fluid to the stabilizing
# force due to the the viscosity of the fluid and heat transfer by
# conduction.
# Therefore, we set here all the parameters which are parts of the 
# Rayleigh formula to 1, except for the gravity component. The value
# given to gravity then specifies the Rayleigh number value.

# at infinite Prandtl number 3D spherical shell that is heated from
# below and cooled from above.

# The initial temperature is given by the sum of a conductive profile
# together with a perturbation. The perturbation determines the final
# patterns of the polyhedral symmetry which is here cubic.

    # The vertical (radial or depth) wave number allows the user to prescribe 
    # a single up/downswing or half periods. 
    set Vertical wave number   = 1
    # For the cubic initial condition temperature, the axisymmetric
    # spherical harmonic is of degree l = 4 and order m = 0.

    set Lateral wave number m2 = 4
    # The magnitude specifies the magitude of the perturbation.
    set Magnitude              = 0.01
    # A perturbation parameter has been introduced to slowly perturb
    # the amplitude of the nonaxisymmetric mode. Set to 0 means the
    # perturbation is full; set to 1 and there is no perturbation (i.e
    # the initial condition temperature profile is only axissymmetric)

# mesh globally and adaptively.

end

# In order to get similar results to CitcomS at low resolution, 2 factors
# in the entropy viscosity (cR) and artificial viscosity (beta) stabilization
# have to be set to 0 (or at least one of them). See the 2012 paper by 
# Kronbichler, Heister and Bangerth that describes ASPECT for more information.
subsection Discretization
  subsection Stabilization parameters
    # beta controls the maximum dissipation of the entropy viscosity,
    # which is the part that only scales with the cell diameter and
    # the maximum velocity in the cell, but does not depend on the
    # solution field itself nor its residual.

# The final section allows us to choose which postprocessors to run
# at the end of each time step. We select to generate graphical
# output that will consist of the primary variables (velocity and 
# temperature) as well as the density and stain. We also select to
# compute some statistics about the velocity field, heat flow and 
# temperature.
