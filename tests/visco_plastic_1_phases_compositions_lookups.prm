# Copy of visco_plastic_phases.prm, but include multiple
# compositions and have different numbers of phase transitions
# for one composition.

# The difference relative to visco_plastic_phases.prm outputs
# is rheologies are assigned based on the dominant phases from
# a lookup table.
# Dominant phases are determined from a lookup table based on a
# column of dominant phases (currently only available for
# PerpleX lookup tables) at a given pressure and temperature.
# However, other properties, such as densities, are not yet
# assigned based on a lookup table.
# Therefore, currently only the pressure, temperature, and
# dominant phase columns are actively used in the lookup
# table (constant_material_small.txt)
