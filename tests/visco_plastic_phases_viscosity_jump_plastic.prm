# This test does the same as the test visco_plastic_phases_viscosity. The differences are:
#   a. Properties are input by the differences (or jumps) between adjacent phases in one composition.
#   b. All compositions use the same one small value for the diffusion creep's prefactor 5e-31 in
#      order to test the interface implemented.
#   c. Different values of the angle of friction are used for the 3 phases for the background composition
#      (0.5, 0.05, 0.005 in terms of friction).
#      These are input by the differences between adjacent phases as well. The first value is 26.566.
#      The second value is 26.566 -23.703 = 2.863, and the third is 2.863 -2.576 = 0.287
