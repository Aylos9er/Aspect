# This parameter file tests similar properties as no_dirichlet_on_noflow,
# but for boundaries that have no flow across the boundary. It also uses
# a different setup. The model is a simple shear flow in a box, with
# the top boundary being tangential, the bottom prescribed as zero flow,
# and both side boundaries have portions of in-/outflow.
