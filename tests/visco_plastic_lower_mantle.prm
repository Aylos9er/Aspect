# A test for adding an option to modify the flow law parameters below a certain pressure
# in the flow laws for the visco_plastic material model.
# This is useful for mantle simulation in which the lower mantle deforms differently from
# the upper mantle. 
# This option changes the grain size and activation volumes used in all compositions 
# AND sets the activation volume for dislocation creep in the lower mantle very high so
# that it uses the diffusion creep flow law only below the precribed pressure
# This test modified the visco_plastic_diffusion_dislocation_composite test by setting
# these parameters:
# set Lower mantle pressure for rheology change = 4.65e9 # 50 km assuming 32496 Pa/m
# set Grain size lower mantle = 10.0e-3  
# set Activation volume lower mantle = 2.0e-6  
# At the surface P = 3e9 Pa (as defined in original test) 
# strain-rate = 4.48e-16 (from applied pure shear) and eta-comp ~ 3.43e18 Pa s.
# At the bottom of the box (100 km) P = 3e9 + 3300*100e3*10 = 6.3e9 Pa (with g = 10 m/s^2)
# but with dynamic pressure P=6.15e9. For this pressure, eta-diff ~ 2.45e21 Pa s
# Also, the viscosity jumps between 40 km and 50 km depth as prescribed.
