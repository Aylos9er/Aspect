# This test uses the rheology_checker material model plugin
# to output computed deformation properties
# (such as strain rate and the first stress derivative of the strain rate)
# at a given strain rate. The plugin can easily be modified to accept
# multiple rheology modules. It doesn't actually use these modules,
# it is just a vessel for functions calculating and outputting properties
# at fixed stress / strain conditions.
