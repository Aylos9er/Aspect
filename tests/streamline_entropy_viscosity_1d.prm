# This is a test for the streamline entropy viscosity method that is a setup
# described in Thieulot, PEPI, 2011, Appendix A. It creates a lateral pipe
# with a prescribed flow and a temperature jump that moves with the flow.
# With sufficient stabilization, no oscillations should occur. Since the
# flow is always parallel to the temperature gradient, in this setup there
# should be no difference between the entropy viscosity method, and streamline
# entropy viscosity method.
