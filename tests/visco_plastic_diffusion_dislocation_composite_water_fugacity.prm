# A test for composite creep in the visco_plastic material model which includes effects from
# water fugacity. The composite creep viscosity (vis_composite) is defined as:
#   (vis_diffusion * vis_dislocation)/(vis_diffusion + vis_dislocation)
# Where vis_diffusion and vis_dislocation are the normal diffusion viscosity and 
# dislocation viscosity multiplied by the concentration of water given as H ppm Si.
# In this model, half of the box is hydrated with a water concentratin of 100 H ppm Si,
# and the other half of the box has 0 H ppm Si. The viscosity is therefore reduced in
# the region where there is water relative to the region that has no water.
