New: ASPECT now has two additional input parameters 'Allow fixed temperature on
closed boundaries', and 'Allow fixed composition on closed boundaries' that
allow to toggle prescribed boundary conditions on boundaries that have no
normal flow (either as part of free-slip boundary conditions, or prescribed,
but tangential flow).  Previously these boundary conditions would always be
handled as the boundary conditions on inflow boundaries (ASPECT 2.4.0 and
before) or as the boundary conditions on outflow boundaries (ASPECT 2.5.0).
