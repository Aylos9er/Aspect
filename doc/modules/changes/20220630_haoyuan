New: The values of the properties of material phases can be entered
by the differences between adjacent phases. If this is the case,
then all the phase properties need to be entered by a value for the first phase
followed by M-1 values for the differences between adjacent phases. 
Otherwise, the phase properties are entered by M values, one for each phase.
Also note that when the option is true, the differences of the log values rather than
the differences of the values are used
for the "Prefactors" in the flow laws.
