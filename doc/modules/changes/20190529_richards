New: There is a new initial temperature plug-in that determines 
initial temperature from a shear wave velocity (Vs) model (in km s$^-1$),
using the anelasticity parameterisation of Yamauchi & Takei 2016. This
plug-in is essentially the same as that used in the
benchmarks/yamauchi_takei_2016_anelasticity folder.
