New: The "Compositional fields" subsection in ASPECT has a new parameter called
"Types of fields" that is used to specify the types of all the "compositional" fields.
The parameter is used to fill a new FieldTypeIndices structure,
that itself contains a series of std::vector<unsigned int>
objects containing the indices of the fields corresponding to each type.
This structure can be called from within material models
via this->introspection().get_field_type_indices().
