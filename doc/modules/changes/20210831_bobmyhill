New: The "Compositional fields" subsection in ASPECT has a new parameter called
"Types of fields" that is used to specify the types of all the
"compositional" fields. Supported types are currently
"chemical_composition", "stress", "grain_size", "porosity", or "generic".
The parameter is used to fill a vector of FieldDescription objects
that store metadata about each field.
This vector can be called from within material models
via this->introspection().get_field_descriptions().
