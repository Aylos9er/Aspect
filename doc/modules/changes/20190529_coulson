New: There is a new material model plug-in that sets a constant 
viscosity above the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary,
which is specified by an ascii file or a maximum lithosphere depth 
value. Below this the viscosity is taken from any base material model.
All other material properties are taken from the base model.
