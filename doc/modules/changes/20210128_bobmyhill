Changed: The multicomponent incompressible equation of state now uses the
user-defined reference temperature even when adiabatic heating is turned on.
If users have previously used this model with adiabatic heating turned on
(for example, as part of the visco_plastic material model),
they can obtain identical results by setting the reference temperature
in the material model equal to the surface adiabatic temperature.
