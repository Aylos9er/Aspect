Changed: The reference temperature for the multicomponent incompressible
equation of state is now set to either the adiabatic surface temperature
(if adiabatic heating is turned off), or the
temperature along the reference adiabat at the local static pressure
(when adiabatic heating is turned on).
If users have previously used this model with adiabatic heating turned off
and a user-defined reference temperature that is not equal to the
adiabatic surface temperature, they should change the reference densities
in their model according to the expression
new_densities[i] = old_densities[i] * (1 - thermal_expansivities[i] *
(adiabatic_surface_temperature - old_reference_temperature)). The results
will not be exactly the same, because the thermal expansivity implied
by the form of the density equation is only identical to the defined
expansivity at the reference temperature.
