Changed: The reference temperature for the multicomponent incompressible
equation of state is now set to either the adiabatic surface temperature
(if adiabatic heating is turned off), or the
temperature along the reference adiabat at the local static pressure
(when adiabatic heating is turned on).
If users have previously used this model with adiabatic heating turned off
and a user-defined reference temperature that was a) not equal to the
adiabatic surface temperature and b) intended to be the temperature
corresponding to the reference density and thermal expansivity
(for example, experimentally-determined properties at room temperature),
they should change the properties to be those corresponding to the
adiabatic surface temperature. The results will not be exactly the same,
because the thermal expansivity implied by the form of the density equation
is only identical to the defined expansivity at the reference temperature.
