New: The profile sampling scheme in the gravity_point_values postprocessor 
permits to calculate gravity and its components on a profile along the radius. 
New: Replace density at quadrature points by PREM. This is mainly for a 
benchmark. 
New: Output file with some statistics such as the average gravity, average 
potential and gradients.
