 * <p> This is the list of changes made after the release of Aspect version
 * 1.0. All entries are signed with the names of the author. </p>
 *
 * * <ol>
 * <li>New: There is a new plugin architecture for heating models that
 * allows for plugins defining the radiogenic heating rate in dependency
 * of temperature, pressure, composition, position and time. This introduces
 * an incompatibility of input files to older versions, but the old functionality
 * is preserved and extended.

 * (Rene Gassmoeller, 2014/05/16)
 *
 * <li>Fixed: Times associated with visualization output are now correctly
 * modified when "Use years in output instead of seconds" is true.
